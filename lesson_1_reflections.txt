How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By showing and comparing the previous code which was working fine.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By preventing breaking working functionalities by creating new ones.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are that you have the control of what is saved and what is 
    not, since maybe some changes are for debugging purposes. The cons
    are that sometimes maybe the new implementations may not be saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Since git is for projects where contains a lot of files, it is
    wisely to do that way. Since an update of the project can be an
    update of several times at the same time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
By viewing the changes of files for each commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I immplement something that may not work very well I can 
    restablish where the project was at.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To create my own project.
